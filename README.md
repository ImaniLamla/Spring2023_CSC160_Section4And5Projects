### Section 4 and 5 Project: <br>
Zoo_Keeper_App
### Description Of The Program: <br>
The Zookeeper App is a simple app that keeps track of a variety of zoo animals. The program allows the user to instantiate different types of Animal objects and to assign values to specific fields associated with each type of Animal.<br>
### Purpose Of This Program: <br>
The Zookeeper App is an assignment created by my Programming Fundamentals 2 lecturer to develop my skills in OOP. This project is part of Section 4 and 5 of the syllabus which focuses on packages, inheritance, interfaces and abstraction. This assignment allowed me to practice coding parent classes and child classes that inherit from their base classes. A knew concept that I learned about was generic types. It was interesting to leran about the beneficial uses of generic types. I also leraned more about method overloading and overriding. Although this program does not do much, it was the perfect example to use to practice these new OOP concepts. <br>
### Components Of This Program: <br>
This program contains 8 Java classes, 2 enums and 2 interfaces. <br><br>
The classes: <br>
<ul>
<li>Animal Class (Creates an abstract Animal object)</li>
<li>Bird Class (Creates an abstract Burd object)</li>
<li>Fish Class (Creates an abstract Fish object)</li>
<li>Chicken Class (Creates a concrete Chicken object)</li>
<li>Sparrow Class (Creates a concrete Sparrow object)</li>
<li>Guppy Class (Creates a concrete Guppy object)</li>
<li>FlyingFish Class (Creates a concrete FlyingFish object)</li>
<li>Zoo_Keeper_App (Houses the main method to run the program)</li>
</ul> <br>
The enums: <br>
<ul>
<li>Gender (Stores the different genders)</li>
<li>Water (Stores the fish's water type)</li>
</ul> <br>
The interfaces: <br>
<ul>
<li>Fly (Implemented by animals that can fly)</li>
<li>Swim (Implemented by animals that can swim)</li>
</ul> <br>
The Bird and Fish class inherit from the Animal class, while Chicken and Sparrow are both child classes of Bird and Guppy and FlyingFish are both child classes of Fish. <br>
